# Minesweeper
Minesweeper is a classic computer game where the objective is to clear a board containing hidden mines without detonating any of them. In this console version of the game, the player can reveal cells on the board and flag cells that they think contain mines.

## Usage
To play the game, simply run the minesweeper.py file using Python. The game board size and number of mines can be adjusted by modifying the width, height, and num_mines variables at the bottom of the file.

When the game starts, the player will be prompted to enter the x and y coordinates of the cell they want to reveal or flag, as well as the desired action ('r' to reveal, 'f' to flag/unflag).

My highest score is 13 turns without a mine :)

## Example

```sh
Enter x coordinate: 3
Enter y coordinate: 4
Enter 'r' to reveal, 'f' to flag/unflag: r
```
